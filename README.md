Website with my resume and portfolio.  Started out as style teplate and will rebuilt with React.  Uses Ajax to pull user data from Node/Express API server.  Currently the API call pulls a local copy of the json file as I don't have an active Domain/SSL cert for the server.  Server still works fine over HTTP - 54.149.237.33/getdata.
